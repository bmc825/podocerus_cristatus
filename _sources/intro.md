## Background

Diversity drives both adaptation and evolutionary change, and color polymorphism is among the most conspicuous manifestations of intraspecific diversity {cite:p}`Bond2007`. While color plasticity involves traits that can change over time, color polymorphism is rooted in inherited traits that yield two or more distinct phenotypes within a population. Such variation may be an adaptive response to visual predation or a product of nonadaptive processes. Consequently, understanding how morph-specific ecology and habitat use shape color variation is crucial for determining if—and how—natural selection maintains these traits.

*Podocerus cristatus* (Caprelloidea: Podoceridae) is a marine amphipod that displays striking color polymorphism and inhabits branching substrata (e.g., hydroids, red algae, sponges) in subtidal habitats {cite:p}`Chapman2007`. Originally described from New Zealand {cite:p}`Thomson1879` and recorded along the west coast of North America, *P. cristatus* may represent a species complex {cite:p}`Barnard1962, BoydEtAl2002, Goddard2016`. Most individuals exhibit muted colors and blend into their environment, potentially reducing detection by fish predators {cite:p}`Hobson1968, Johnsen2012, CroninEtAl2014`. However, some are brightly colored, including forms that resemble local aposematic nudibranchs {cite:p}`Goddard2016`, hinting at a possible Batesian mimicry strategy. Still others exhibit striking red fluorescence that does not match obvious cues in their surroundings (personal observation).

Here, we present the pipeline for the first natural history survey of *P. cristatus* to investigate color variation within populations and microhabitats. We compare color types and population characteristics with local microhabitat types and coloration, nudibranch occurrence, geographic location, and species-level genetic markers. Live individuals are also observed *ex situ* to assess plasticity in color traits and behaviors.

## Rationale

Without baseline data on population structure and microhabitat associations, the role of color strategies in \emph{P. cristatus} remains unclear. This study quantifies morph variation, camouflage strategies, and species occurrence in a local population of \emph{P. cristatus}, and models their relationships with ecological predictors. It was hypothesized that (H1) camouflage strategies vary based on microhabitat type, and (H2) individuals select microhabitats that enhance concealment. Given suspected behavioral differences between sexes, it was also predicted that (H3) certain morphs are sex-specific, and (H4) camouflage strategies differ between sexes, with males exhibiting more disruptive coloration and females exhibiting more background matching. The evolutionary context of \emph{P. cristatus} polymorphism was further examined by analyzing genetic differentiation among morphs across additional geographic populations.

## Outline:

00. Morph Classification (**Cluster Analysis**)

0. Sex and Morph Variation with Microhabitat, Nudibranchs, and Site (**Population Structure Analysis**)

1. **H1** Camouflage Variation with Microhabitat (**Models 1-3, 5, 6**)
    
2. **H2** Camouflage Variation with Microhabitat Association (**Models 4-6**)

3. **H3** Morph Variation with Sex (**Cluster Analysis, Population Structure Analysis, Model 4**)
