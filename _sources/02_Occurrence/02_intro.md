# Question 2

**Microhabitat Variation in Occurrence and Color Patterns (Models 1, 2, 3)**

-  What environmental factors (i.e., microhabitat and nudibranch presence) influence the occurrence of P. cristatus in quadrats? *This examines the conditions under which P. cristatus is present or absent.*
    
    -  Does microhabitat influence the occurrence of P. cristatus *ex situ*? *This directly tests the conditions under which P. cristatus is present or absent.*
    
    >***Note: ** We could not test hydroids with and without bryozoans, so this test is just to confirm the results from Model 2 which showed no preference for any single hydroid or red algae.*
        
-  How does the occurrence of males and females vary across microhabitats and in relation to nudibranch presence? *This assesses if the probability of finding males or females within quadrats containing P. cristatus differs with environmental conditions.*
    
-  How does the occurrence of different morphs (e.g., Red-Beige, White, Bright) vary across microhabitats and in relation to nudibranch presence? *This assesses if the probability of finding different morphs within quadrats containing P. cristatus differs with environmental conditions.*
