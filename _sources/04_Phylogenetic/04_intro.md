# Question 4

**Species-Level Variation (Phylogenetic Analysis)**
-  How do color types vary with geographic location and species-level genetic markers?

By integrating these questions, we aim to elucidate how intrinsic (e.g., sex, fecundity, size) and extrinsic (e.g., microhabitat structure, nudibranch presence, geographic location) factors shape *P. cristatus* coloration and camouflage strategies. Ultimately, this work will provide insight into the selective mechanisms that drive and maintain polymorphism in this amphipod.
