# Question 3

**Camouflage Strategy Variation (Models 4, 5, 6)**
-  Do color patterns vary between sexes and sizes?
-  Does camouflage strength (e.g., background matching, edge disruption) vary between males and females across microhabitats?
-  Do males and females have stronger camouflage on microhabitat on which they were found than on microhabitat on which they were not found?
